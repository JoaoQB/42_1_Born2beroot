A virtual machine is a computer inside a computer, a machine inside another
machine.
By using virtualization, that is by creating virtual "hardware" that borrows
the real hardware's resources, we can have several systems running on one
machine, as if they were running on separate machines.

Hypervisor or virtual machine monitor is a piece of software that enables a user
to create and run one or more VMs simultaneously. It controls the resources
of the host machine and allocates to each VM the resources it needs (memory,
CPU...). We'll be using VirtualBox. It's free and opensource. It's a type 2
hypervisor. Type 2 hypervisor is installed on the host OS. The VM OS is the
guest OS. Type 1 hypervisor is installed straight on to the hardware.
The type 2 has to ask the host OS for it's resources while the type 1 controls
the show and has full access to the resources.

Why use a VM?
	To develop Hacking, to learn different OSs, to break stuff.
	It's more convenient and cheaper to install a VM than to buy another computer.
	It's maintenance is very low compared to a server or other physical
	machines. You save a lot of space. When a physical server crashes it can
	be complex to recover it's data. The software aspect of VMs simplifies
	data backup.
	By using snapshots, it allows you to restore the VM to it's previous state.
	(see useful_links)
	Virtualization also allows you to increase the security of your data by
	partitioning them and isolating services on different servers.
	Each VM is isolated from the others, including the host system. It limits
	the risk of propagation in case of malware intrusion. Also if it crashes,
	other VMs are not affected. To summarize:
		-Inexpensive
		-Save physical space
		-Less maintenance than a physical machine
		-Data backup simplified
		-Increased security
		-Experiment with OSs
		-Break stuff
		-Hacking

Operating systems
	Every machine runs on a OS, which is a set of programs that allows to run and
	control a machine. It can be seen as the bridge between the user and the software.
	It's part of the system software like OS, device drivers, firmware, boot loaders..
	The Kernel is the bridge between the OS and the hardware. It's main purpose
	is to manage memory, disks, taks and processes. A system always has an OS and
	an OS always has a kernel. (see useful_links)

Debian vs Rocky:
	Debian is easier to install and configure so better for personal servers.
	Debian is easier to update when a new version is released, is more user-friendly
	and supports many libraries, filesystems and architecture. More options for custo-
	-misation.
	Rocky is enterprise-oriented, built on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Provides
	commercial support. Rocky uses DNF while Debian uses apt-get as package manager.

Linux File System:
	Defined by the fyle system hierarchy standard.
	'/'
		The root directory, it's the uppermost directory in Linux containing
		all the files, device data and system info in the form of directories.
	'/bin'
		Contains binaries or executables essential to the entire OS.
		Like vim, curl, ls, wall..
	'/sbin'
		Contains system binaries and executables essential for super user (root).
		Like mount, deluser..
	'/lib'
		Many of this binaries may share common libraries (shared code between
		binaries), stored in /lib.
	'/usr'
		Contains its own /bin and /sbin directories, which are not essential for
		the OS, but are intended for the end user. There's also a local folder
		inside which are binaries we compiled mannualy. To know where a binary lives
		run 'which binary_name' to see it's full path.
	'/etc'
		Editable text configuration, where text based config files live to be able
		to costumize the behaviour of the software on my system. Like zshrc, passwd..
	'/home'
		Contains different users directories, it contains the files, configurations
		for that user. ~ shortcut to home.
	'/boot'
		Contains files needed to boot the system like the linux kernel itself.
		Contains data that is used before the Kernel begins executing user-mode programs.
	'/dev'
		Stands for devie files. To interface with hardware or drivers as if they
		were files itself. Can create disk partitions here or interface with my
		floppy drive.
	'/opt'
		Optional or add-on software.
	'/var'
		Contains variable files that will change as the OS is being used. Things
		like logs or cache files.
	'/tmp'
		Contains files that won't be persisted between reboots.
	'/proc'
		Illusionary file system that doesn't exist on the harddrive itself but is
		created in memory on the fly by the kernel itself to keep track of running
		processes.

Difference between Aptitude and APT:
	Aptitude is a high level package manager that uses APT in the background while
	APT is low level that can be used by other higher level package managers.
	Aptitude will automatically remove unused packages or suggest installations.
	APT will only do what is told to do in the command line. APT comes with Debian.

What is AppArmor:
	Linux security system that provides MAC security. Allows system admin to restrict
	the actions that processes can perform. If UFW was the security in 42 school,
	that controls who gets in and out, AppaArmor would be the wall behind the bocal,
	it protects specific places or apps.

What is UFW:
	Interface to modify the firewall of a device without compromising security.
	It could be otherwise done with Iptables, but that can be quite hard.
	Use it to configure which ports to allow connections to, and which to close.
	Useful in conjunction with SSH.

What is SSH:
	SSH is an authentication mechanism between a client and a host. Allows two
	computers to securely talk with each other. Can access my server from another
	pc's terminal

What is Cron:
	A command line utilty to schedule commands or scripts to happen at specific time
	intervals or specific time each day. Useful if you want to set your server to
	restart at a specific time each day.
